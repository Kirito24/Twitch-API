Cheeking if Stream is Online or Offline

When i was writing this project I learned how to use .append JQuery function.
The think that i don't know how to do, is to make a input where you can write the twitch channel name, and it will show if this channel is offline or online, i know that i need to add value of the input to Array, but it is not working either.
